# Machine-Learning-Project
Brain tumors are a significant health concern, and early detection is critical for effective treatment.
In this project, we'll explore a comprehensive approach to brain tumor detection using machine learning techniques.
We will showcase the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in our project.
Let's dive into the details of how these techniques work together to improve brain tumor detection accuracy.
